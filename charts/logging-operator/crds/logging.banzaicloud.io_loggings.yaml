                                is the only supported data source. If the provisioner
                                can support VolumeSnapshot data source, it will create
                                a new volume and data will be restored to the volume
                                at the same time. If the provisioner does not support
                                VolumeSnapshot data source, volume will not be created

                                is the only supported data source. If the provisioner
                                can support VolumeSnapshot data source, it will create
                                a new volume and data will be restored to the volume
                                at the same time. If the provisioner does not support
                                VolumeSnapshot data source, volume will not be created
                                and the failure will be reported as an event. In the

                          means match all taint effects. When specified, allowed values
                          are NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule and NoExecute.

                          to. Empty means match all taint keys. If the key is empty,
                          operator must be Exists; this combination means to match
                          all values and all keys.

                          value. Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to
                          Equal. Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that
                          a pod can tolerate all taints of a particular category.

                          the toleration (which must be of effect NoExecute, otherwise
                          this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default,
                          it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do
                          not evict). Zero and negative values will be treated as
                          0 (evict immediately) by the system.
